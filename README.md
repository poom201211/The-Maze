### What we have learnt

We thought that this project is worth making because we will be using a program which is still in the borders of java, meaning we are going to be able to implement most of the knowledge we have learnt from you(Mr.James). Other than that, we will be learning new knowledge to do with 3D modeling, Jmonkey(Gaming engine based on java) and pretty much how different it is as a whole. The actual making process was mostly spent on understanding the program. Even the making of the maze map took us a day. Our hardest task was learning the SDK(JMoneky) itself and the xml language(Similar to fxml). In our eyes this project was a success as we spent alot of time getting the feeling of working as a team.
